Flutter Bloc Practice

## Getting Started

The purpose of the project is to practice the Flutter Bloc architectural pattern.
I use the default flutter counter app that is generated when creating a new flutter 
project and rewrite it using the bloc architecture.

The main goals of this project are understanding:

1. Creating and consuming blocs.

2. Testing of bloc classes and methods.

3. Bloc access including local, inherited and global access.
