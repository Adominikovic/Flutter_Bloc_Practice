# Flutter BloC Practice Project

Flutter BloC Practice

The purpose of the project is to practice the Flutter BloC architectural pattern.
I use the default flutter counter app and rewrite using the bloc architecture.

The main goals of this project are understanding:

1. Creating and consuming blocs.

2. Testing of bloc classes and methods.

3. Bloc access including local, inherited and global access.

4. Routing methods using blocs (anonymous, named and generated routes).

5. Bloc to bloc communication using StreamSubscription and BlocListener.
